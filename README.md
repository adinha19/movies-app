# Movies App
This is an application where users can search and rate movies, movies are sorted by highest rating. 
Users can search movies by title, description, year.    
Users can also search by:  
- less than 1,2,3,4,5 stars
- 1,2,3,4,5 stars,
- more than 1,2,3,4,5 stars
- after year /year/
- before year /year/
- year /year/  
I know this is not the best way to implement this kind of search by common terms, but this was the first time i encountered a problem like this.
